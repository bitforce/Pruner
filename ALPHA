Perform testing and figure out all the kinks--perhaps create a testing env. In
addition, you may want to rename this project since Homebrew already has a tap
with the same name (find out what that tap does). Also, if there exist a brew
repo name checker, figure out what names you can take; otherwise, search and
find one, then make your project brew-tapable and then create a brew tap
searcher.

UPDATE
------
Found out that rinse is available and therefore, you should fix the project to 
best standard and then change all the names to rinse.
